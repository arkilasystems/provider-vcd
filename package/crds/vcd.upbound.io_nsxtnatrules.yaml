        description: NsxtNatRule is the Schema for the NsxtNatRules API. Provides
          a resource to manage NSX-T NAT rules. To change the source IP address from
          a private to a public IP address, you create a source NAT (SNAT) rule. To
          change the destination IP address from a public to a private IP address,
          you create a destination NAT (DNAT) rule.

                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
