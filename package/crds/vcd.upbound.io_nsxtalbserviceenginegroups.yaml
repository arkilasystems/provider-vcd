        description: NsxtAlbServiceEngineGroup is the Schema for the NsxtAlbServiceEngineGroups
          API. Provides a resource to manage ALB Service Engine Groups. A Service
          Engine Group is an isolation domain that also defines shared service engine
          properties, such as size, network access, and failover. Resources in a service
          engine group can be used for different virtual services, depending on your
          tenant needs. These resources cannot be shared between different service
          engine groups.

                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                  WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,
                  and password required to connect to the managed resource.
                  This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
                  PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting
                  each other.
