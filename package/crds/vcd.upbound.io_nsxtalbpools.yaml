        description: NsxtAlbPool is the Schema for the NsxtAlbPools API. Provides
          a resource to manage ALB Pools for particular NSX-T Edge Gateway. Pools
          maintain the list of servers assigned to them and perform health monitoring,
          load balancing, persistence. A pool may only be used or referenced by only
